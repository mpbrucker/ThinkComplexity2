This paper investigates the spreading of epidemics in scale-free networks. Using a *susceptible-infected-susceptible* model in which nodes are susceptible, become infected, and recover to become susceptible again, fixed-size networks have an epidemic threshold, a rate of spreading below which the disease dies out. Vespignani and Pastor-Satorras apply this model to scale-free networks, with two important discoveries. Firstly, in scale-free networks, the epidemic eventually reaches a steady state where the proportion of infected nodes remains the same. The second discovery is that this proportion is always > 0 for any disease that has a nonzero rate of infection. They compute these findings by investigating epidemics in the Internet, using data from the spreading of computer viruses as validation.
