[Hipsters on Networks: How a Small Group of Individuals Can Lead to an
Anti-Establishment Majority](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07187.pdf)  
*Juul, Jonas S; Porter, Mason A.,* **arXiv:1707.07187** [physics.soc-ph]

*Juul and Porter explore the concept of how anti-establishment nodes ("hipsters") affect the spreading of two competing products. They build on threshold models of social influence by introducing two types of nodes: conformist nodes, which adopt the product most popular among their immediate neighbors, and hipster nodes, which adopt the less popular of two products. Juul and Porter found that a small proportion of hipsters was enough to make the products equally popular across all types of networks they tested. They conclude that this model could be particularly useful in explaining how anti-establishment candidates win political elections.*
